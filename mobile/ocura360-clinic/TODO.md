## 📝 Notes

- All components use Tailwind CSS (NativeWind) for consistency with web
- Mock data will be used initially before API integration
- Role-based access control must be implemented throughout
- Mobile-optimized layouts (cards instead of tables)
- Camera and notifications are mobile-specific features
