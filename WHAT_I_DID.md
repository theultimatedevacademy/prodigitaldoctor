I've implemented all 4 phases of your landing page enhancement with pre-launch/post-launch switching capability. Everything is ready to start collecting waitlist signups!

- Automatically shows/hides sections based on mode
- Countdown timer to your launch date
- Dynamic CTAs (Join Waitlist vs Start Free Trial)
- Waitlist progress tracking

**Your Control:**
```env
# Change this one variable to switch modes
VITE_LAUNCH_MODE=prelaunch   # Now: Waitlist mode
VITE_LAUNCH_MODE=launched    # Later: Trial mode
```
