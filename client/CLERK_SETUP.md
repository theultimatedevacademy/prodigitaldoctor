# Clerk Integration Setup

## ✅ Completed Steps

1. **Installed Clerk SDK**: `@clerk/clerk-react@latest` has been added to your dependencies
2. **Created `.env.example`**: Template file for environment variables
3. **Updated `main.jsx`**: App is now wrapped with `<ClerkProvider>`
4. **Updated `Header.jsx`**: Demonstrates Clerk's prebuilt auth components

## 🔧 Required: Get Your Clerk Publishable Key

1. Go to [https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/react](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/react)
2. Sign up for a Clerk account (if you don't have one)
3. Create a new application in the Clerk Dashboard
4. Copy your **Publishable Key** from the dashboard

## 📝 Final Steps

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the `client/` directory:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Open `.env.local` and replace the placeholder with your actual Clerk Publishable Key:
   ```
   VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_key_here
   ```

3. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🎯 What's Implemented

### `main.jsx`
- Imports `ClerkProvider` from `@clerk/clerk-react`
- Loads `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` from environment variables
- Wraps the entire app with `<ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY} afterSignOutUrl="/">`
- Includes error handling for missing publishable key

### `Header.jsx`
- Uses `<SignedOut>` to show Sign In/Sign Up buttons when user is not authenticated
- Uses `<SignedIn>` to show `<UserButton>` when user is authenticated
- Styled with Tailwind CSS classes

## 🚀 Using Clerk in Other Components

You can now use Clerk's hooks and components throughout your app:

```javascript
import { useUser, useAuth } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

function MyComponent() {
  const { isSignedIn, user } = useUser();
  const { signOut } = useAuth();
  
  if (!isSignedIn) return <div>Please sign in</div>;
  
  return <div>Hello, {user.firstName}!</div>;
}
```
