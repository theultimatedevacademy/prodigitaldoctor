## 🔑 Environment Variables Needed

### Root `.env`
```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
PORT=5000
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### `client/.env`
```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Install Packages
```bash
npm install @clerk/clerk-sdk-node cors
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
- Get Clerk keys from https://dashboard.clerk.com/
- Add keys to `.env` files

### 3. Start Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Assign User Roles

**In Clerk Dashboard:**
1. Go to Users
2. Select a user
3. Click "Metadata" tab
4. Add to Public Metadata:
   ```json
   {
     "roles": ["doctor"]
   }
   ```
   or
   ```json
   {
     "roles": ["patient"]
   }
   ```

### 5. Test
- Sign in as doctor → See DoctorDashboard
- Sign in as patient → See PatientDashboard

## 🔄 How It Works

### Authentication Flow

```
User Signs In
    ↓
Clerk Authenticates
    ↓
Client Receives JWT Token
    ↓
Client Calls GET /api/auth/me with token
    ↓
Server Verifies Token with Clerk
    ↓
Server Finds/Creates User in MongoDB
    ↓
Server Returns User Profile with Roles
    ↓
RoleBasedDashboard Component Routes Based on Role
    ↓
User Sees Appropriate Dashboard
```

### Role-Based Routing

- **Doctor Role** → `DoctorDashboard.jsx`
  - View patients
  - Create prescriptions
  - Manage appointments
  - Clinic management

- **Patient Role** → `PatientDashboard.jsx`
  - View own prescriptions
  - Book appointments
  - View medical history

---

## 🛡️ Security Features

✅ **JWT Token Verification** - All API requests verified with Clerk
✅ **Role-Based Access Control** - Users can only access routes for their role
✅ **Protected Routes** - Authentication required for all app routes
✅ **Automatic User Creation** - Users created in DB on first login
✅ **Token Refresh** - Automatic token refresh on expiry
✅ **CORS Protection** - Only client URL can access API

---

## 🎨 UI Changes

### Landing Page
- "Sign In" button (general login)
- "Start Free Trial - Doctor" button (signup as doctor)
- "Patient Sign In" button (patient login)

All buttons redirect to `/dashboard` after authentication, where role-based routing takes over.

## 📊 Database Schema

### User Model (already exists)
```javascript
{
  clerkId: String,          // Unique Clerk user ID
  roles: [String],          // ['doctor', 'patient', 'admin', etc.]
  name: String,
  email: String,
  phone: String,
  profilePhotoUrl: String,
  qualifications: String,   // For doctors
  specializations: [String], // For doctors
  hprId: String,            // For doctors
  clinics: [ObjectId],      // For doctors
  linkedPatientCodes: [...]  // For linking patients
}
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No token provided"
**Solution:** Check Clerk keys are set in environment variables

### Issue: "Invalid token"
**Solution:** Verify secret key matches publishable key's app

### Issue: User stuck on "Role Not Assigned"
**Solution:** Add roles to user's public metadata in Clerk Dashboard

### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution:** Verify CLIENT_URL in .env matches client URL

### Issue: Module not found
**Solution:** Run `npm install @clerk/clerk-sdk-node cors`

## ✅ Success Criteria

Your implementation is successful when:

1. ✅ Users can sign up via Clerk
2. ✅ Users automatically get profiles in MongoDB
3. ✅ Doctors see DoctorDashboard with clinic features
4. ✅ Patients see PatientDashboard with patient features
5. ✅ Role-based routes are protected (e.g., patients can't access `/patients`)
6. ✅ API calls include and verify authentication tokens
