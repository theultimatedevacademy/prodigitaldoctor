# Mobile App - Server-Side Search Implementation

## Overview
Implemented server-side search functionality in the mobile app (React Native) for Appointments, Patients, and Prescriptions screens. The mobile app now uses the same backend search endpoints as the web app.

---

## What Changed

### Backend
✅ **No changes required** - The backend search functionality was already implemented for the web app and is fully compatible with the mobile app.

### Mobile App Changes

#### 1. AppointmentsListScreen
**File**: `screens/appointments/AppointmentsListScreen.jsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `useDebounce` hook import
- Added debounced search with 300ms delay
- Passed `search` parameter to API filters
- Removed client-side search filtering (lines 104-123)
- Updated to use `appointments` directly from API response
- Search now queries entire database, not just loaded appointments

**Search Fields**: Patient name, patient code, phone number

#### 2. PatientsListScreen
**File**: `screens/patients/PatientsListScreen.jsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `search` parameter to `usePatients` hook
- Removed client-side search filtering
- Kept client-side filters for gender and age (not yet supported by backend)
- Search now queries entire database

**Search Fields**: Patient name, patient code, phone number

#### 3. PrescriptionsListScreen
**File**: `screens/prescriptions/PrescriptionsListScreen.jsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `useDebounce` hook import
- Added debounced search with 300ms delay
- Passed `search` parameter to API filters
- Removed client-side search filtering (lines 100-119)
- Updated to use `prescriptions` directly from API response
- Search now queries entire database

**Search Fields**: Patient name, patient code, phone number

## Technical Implementation

### Debouncing Pattern
All screens use the same debouncing pattern to avoid excessive API calls:

```javascript
// Debounce search query for server-side search
const debouncedSearch = useDebounce(searchQuery, 300);

// Add to API filters
const apiFilters = useMemo(() => {
  const baseFilters = {
    clinicId: selectedClinicId,
    // ... other filters
  };

  // Add server-side search parameter
  if (debouncedSearch && debouncedSearch.trim().length >= 2) {
    baseFilters.search = debouncedSearch.trim();
  }

  return baseFilters;
}, [selectedClinicId, debouncedSearch, /* other deps */]);
```

### Search Behavior
- **Minimum Length**: 2 characters required (backend validation)
- **Debounce Delay**: 300ms (waits for user to stop typing)
- **Case-Insensitive**: All searches are case-insensitive
- **Partial Match**: Searches for substring matches
- **Special Characters**: Automatically escaped to prevent regex injection

## Testing Guide

### Prerequisites
- Mobile app running on device/emulator
- Backend server running with search endpoints
- Test data: Multiple patients, appointments, and prescriptions

### Test Cases

#### 1. Appointments Screen

**Basic Search**
- [ ] Open Appointments screen
- [ ] Type patient name in search bar
- [ ] Verify: Results appear after 300ms delay
- [ ] Verify: Only matching appointments shown

**Search with Filters**
- [ ] Enter search term
- [ ] Apply status filter (e.g., "Completed")
- [ ] Verify: Results match both search AND filter
- [ ] Apply date range filter
- [ ] Verify: Results match all criteria

**Edge Cases**
- [ ] Type single character → Verify: No search triggered
- [ ] Type 2 characters → Verify: Search triggered
- [ ] Clear search → Verify: All appointments shown
- [ ] Search with no results → Verify: Empty state shown
- [ ] Type quickly → Verify: Only one API call after pause

**Performance**
- [ ] Search with 100+ appointments
- [ ] Verify: Results appear within 1 second
- [ ] Verify: No lag or freezing
- [ ] Pull to refresh during search → Verify: Works correctly

#### 2. Patients Screen

**Basic Search**
- [ ] Open Patients screen
- [ ] Type patient name in search bar
- [ ] Verify: Results appear after 300ms delay
- [ ] Search by patient code → Verify: Works
- [ ] Search by phone number → Verify: Works

**Search with Filters**
- [ ] Enter search term
- [ ] Apply gender filter
- [ ] Verify: Results match both (gender filter is client-side)
- [ ] Apply age range filter
- [ ] Verify: Results match all criteria

**Edge Cases**
- [ ] Search with special characters (e.g., "O'Brien")
- [ ] Verify: Works correctly
- [ ] Search with numbers only (phone)
- [ ] Verify: Finds patients by phone

#### 3. Prescriptions Screen

**Basic Search**
- [ ] Open Prescriptions screen
- [ ] Type patient name in search bar

**Search with Filters**
- [ ] Enter search term
- [ ] Apply date range filter
- [ ] Verify: Results match both criteria
- [ ] Apply doctor filter (if owner/staff)
- [ ] Verify: Results match all criteria

**Edge Cases**
- [ ] Search during loading → Verify: Handles gracefully
- [ ] Navigate away during search → Verify: No errors
- [ ] Return to screen → Verify: Search state preserved

## Mobile-Specific Considerations

### 1. Loading States
- Loading spinner shows while fetching search results
- Pull-to-refresh works during search
- Loading doesn't block UI interaction

### 2. Keyboard Behavior
- Keyboard dismisses on scroll
- Search bar remains accessible
- Keyboard doesn't cover results

### 3. Performance
- Debouncing prevents excessive API calls
- Results load quickly even on slow networks
- No memory leaks or performance degradation

### 4. Offline Behavior
- Search fails gracefully when offline
- Error message shown if network unavailable
- Cached data (if any) still searchable

---

## Known Limitations

### Mobile App
1. **No Pagination**: Mobile app loads all results (unlike web app which has pagination)
2. **Client-Side Filters**: Gender and age filters on Patients screen remain client-side
3. **No Search History**: Search history not saved between sessions
4. **No Autocomplete**: No search suggestions or autocomplete

### Backend
1. **Minimum Search Length**: 2 characters required
2. **Search Fields**: Limited to patient name, code, phone (not doctor name, notes, etc.)
3. **No Fuzzy Search**: Exact substring matching only

---

## Troubleshooting

### Search Not Working
**Symptoms**: Typing in search bar doesn't trigger search

**Solutions**:
1. Check if backend server is running
2. Verify network connection
3. Check console logs for errors
4. Ensure search term is at least 2 characters
5. Check if debounce is working (wait 300ms)

### Slow Search Performance
**Symptoms**: Search takes > 2 seconds to return results

**Solutions**:
1. Check network speed
2. Verify backend database indexes are created
3. Check backend server logs for slow queries
4. Reduce amount of test data if in development

### Search Returns Wrong Results
**Symptoms**: Search results don't match search term

**Solutions**:
1. Verify search term is being passed to backend
2. Check backend logs to see actual query
3. Verify backend search logic is correct
4. Clear app cache and restart

### App Crashes During Search
**Symptoms**: App crashes when searching

**Solutions**:
1. Check console logs for errors
2. Verify API response format is correct
3. Check for null/undefined values in response
4. Verify debounce hook is working correctly

---

## Debug Commands

### Check API Calls
```javascript
// Add to screen component
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('API Filters:', apiFilters);
}, [apiFilters]);
```

### Monitor Search State
```javascript
// Add to screen component
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Search Query:', searchQuery);
  console.log('Debounced Search:', debouncedSearch);
}, [searchQuery, debouncedSearch]);
```

### Check API Response
```javascript
// Add to screen component
useEffect(() => {
  if (appointmentsResponse) {
    console.log('API Response:', {
      count: appointmentsResponse.appointments?.length,
      total: appointmentsResponse.pagination?.total
    });
  }
}, [appointmentsResponse]);
```

---

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Performance
- **Search Response Time**: < 1 second for typical datasets
- **Debounce Delay**: 300ms after last keystroke
- **API Calls**: 1 per search (after debounce)
- **Memory Usage**: No significant increase during search

### Monitoring
Monitor these metrics during testing:
- Time from keystroke to results displayed
- Number of API calls per search session
- Memory usage before/after multiple searches
- Battery usage during extended search sessions

## Support

### Common User Questions

**Q: Why doesn't search work with 1 character?**
A: Search requires minimum 2 characters for performance reasons.

**Q: Why is there a delay when I type?**
A: The 300ms delay (debouncing) prevents excessive server requests and improves performance.

**Q: Can I search by doctor name?**
A: Not currently. Search is limited to patient name, code, and phone number.

**Q: Why don't I see all results?**
A: The mobile app may limit results for performance. Use filters to narrow down results.
