# Refined Role-Based Authentication Workflow

## Overview

The authentication system has been completely redesigned with a streamlined user experience:

1. **Single Sign-In Button** - One unified sign-in/sign-up entry point
2. **Role Selection Modal** - First-time users choose their role from 4 options
3. **Automatic Role Sync** - Role is saved to both MongoDB and Clerk
4. **Role-Based Routing** - Users are automatically routed to the correct dashboard

## Security & Data Flow

### Role Assignment Security

1. **First Assignment Only**
   - Users can only set their role once via modal
   - After initial assignment, role changes require admin access

2. **Role Validation**
   - Backend validates against enum: `['patient', 'doctor', 'assistant', 'clinic_owner', 'admin']`
   - Invalid roles rejected with 400 error

3. **Clerk Sync**
   - Role saved to Clerk public metadata
   - Accessible in JWT token
   - Can be used for client-side role checks

4. **MongoDB as Source of Truth**
   - Primary role storage in MongoDB
   - Clerk metadata kept in sync
   - If Clerk sync fails, MongoDB still updated

### Data Consistency

```javascript
// updateMyRole flow:
1. Validate incoming roles
2. Update MongoDB user.roles
3. Try to update Clerk publicMetadata.roles
4. If Clerk fails, log error but don't fail request
5. Return updated user from MongoDB
```

## Testing the Workflow

### Test Case 1: New User Sign-Up

1. Clear browser cookies/localStorage
2. Navigate to homepage
3. Click "Sign In / Sign Up"
4. Create new account via Clerk
5. **Expected**: Redirected to role selection modal
6. Select "I am a doctor and I work in a clinic"
7. Click "Continue"
8. **Expected**: DoctorDashboard loads

### Test Case 2: Existing User Sign-In

1. Sign out
2. Sign in with previously created account
3. **Expected**: Direct route to DoctorDashboard (no modal)

### Test Case 3: Role Persistence

1. Sign in as doctor
2. Check DoctorDashboard loads
3. Sign out
4. Sign in again
5. **Expected**: Still routes to DoctorDashboard

### Test Case 4: Different Roles

1. Create account, select "Patient"
2. **Expected**: PatientDashboard
3. Create another account, select "Clinic Owner"
4. **Expected**: DoctorDashboard

## Error Handling

### Scenario: API Fails During Role Selection

**Error**: Network error or 500 from server
**Handling**:
- Toast error shown to user
- Modal remains open
- User can retry
- No role assigned until successful

### Scenario: Clerk Sync Fails

**Error**: Clerk API unavailable
**Handling**:
- MongoDB role still saved
- Error logged to console
- User flow continues normally
- Clerk sync can be retried later via admin

### Scenario: Invalid Role Submitted

**Error**: Role not in enum
**Handling**:
- 400 error returned
- Toast shows "Invalid role selected"
- Modal stays open
- User must select valid option

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Role Change Request Flow**
   - Users can request role change
   - Requires admin approval
   - Audit log of role changes

2. **Multi-Role Support**
   - User can have multiple roles
   - Dashboard selector if user has >1 role
   - Example: Doctor + Clinic Owner

3. **Organization Invites**
   - Clinic owners invite staff/doctors
   - Auto-assign appropriate role
   - Link to specific clinic on signup

4. **Role-Based Onboarding**
   - Different onboarding flow per role
   - Guided setup for new doctors
   - Simpler flow for patients

5. **Demo Mode**
   - "Try without signing up"
   - Pre-populated demo data
   - Limited functionality

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Role Modal Appears Every Time

**Cause**: Role not being saved
**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify MongoDB connection
3. Check `/api/auth/my-role` endpoint
4. Ensure roles array is being returned in `/api/auth/me`

### Issue: Wrong Dashboard After Role Selection

**Cause**: Role priority logic
**Check**: `RoleBasedDashboard.jsx` role checking order
**Fix**: Verify role priority: doctor/clinic_owner → assistant → patient

### Issue: Clerk Metadata Not Updating

**Cause**: Clerk API key issues
**Solutions**:
1. Verify `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` is correct
2. Check Clerk API quotas
3. Review error logs in `authController.js`

---

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users

If you have existing users without roles:

1. **Option A: Default Assignment**
   - Run migration script to assign default role
   - Example: All existing users → 'doctor'

2. **Option B: Forced Selection**
   - Keep as-is
   - Users will see role modal on next login
   - No manual intervention needed

### Migration Script Example

```javascript
// scripts/assignDefaultRoles.js
import User from './models/user.js';
import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';

async function assignDefaultRoles() {
  const usersWithoutRoles = await User.find({
    $or: [
      { roles: { $exists: false } },
      { roles: { $size: 0 } }
    ]
  });
  
  for (const user of usersWithoutRoles) {
    // Assign default role
    user.roles = ['doctor'];
    await user.save();
    
    // Update Clerk
    await clerkClient.users.updateUser(user.clerkId, {
      publicMetadata: { roles: ['doctor'] }
    });
  }
  
  console.log(`Updated ${usersWithoutRoles.length} users`);
}
```
