# New Appointment Feature - Complete Implementation

## ✅ What Was Created

### 1. NewAppointmentPage (`/appointments/new`)

**Complete appointment creation form with:**

- ✅ **Patient Selection** - Dropdown showing all patients from selected clinic
- ✅ **Date Picker** - Date selection with minimum date validation (today)
- ✅ **Time Picker** - Time selection
- ✅ **Duration** - Default 30 minutes, adjustable in 5-minute increments
- ✅ **Reason for Visit** - Optional text field
- ✅ **Additional Notes** - Optional textarea for extra information
- ✅ **Form Validation** - All required fields validated
- ✅ **Loading States** - Spinner while creating appointment
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Toast notifications for success/error

### 2. Routes Added

```javascript
// In main.jsx
import NewAppointmentPage from './pages/NewAppointmentPage';

<Route path="appointments/new" element={<NewAppointmentPage />} />
```

### 3. Navigation Updates

**Dashboard:**
- "New Appointment" button now works → links to `/appointments/new`

**AppointmentsPage:**
- "New Appointment" button (header) → links to `/appointments/new`
- "Create First Appointment" button (empty state) → links to `/appointments/new`

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Frontend Data Flow

1. **User fills form** with appointment details
2. **Form validation** checks all required fields
3. **Data transformation:**
   - Combines `date` + `time` → ISO8601 `startAt` timestamp
   - Gets `doctor` from authenticated user context
   - Gets `clinic` from selected clinic context
4. **API call** via `useCreateAppointment` hook
5. **Success:** Navigate to appointments list
6. **Error:** Show error toast

### Backend Integration

**Required fields sent to backend:**
```javascript
{
  clinic: selectedClinicId,
  doctor: user._id,
  patient: formData.patient,
  startAt: "2025-01-08T10:30:00.000Z",
  duration: 30,
  reason: "Follow-up",
  notes: "Additional info...",
  status: "scheduled"
}
```

**Backend validation (from routes/appointments.js):**
- ✅ `clinic` - Required
- ✅ `doctor` - Required
- ✅ `patient` - Required
- ✅ `startAt` - Required (ISO8601 format)

### Form Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Validation |
|-------|------|----------|---------|------------|
| Patient | Dropdown | Yes | - | Must select from list |
| Date | Date | Yes | - | Must be today or future |
| Time | Time | Yes | - | Required |
| Duration | Number | Yes | 30 | Min 5 minutes |
| Reason | Text | No | - | - |
| Notes | Textarea | No | - | - |

## 🎨 UI Components Used

- **Card** - Container for form sections
- **Input** - Text and number inputs
- **Button** - Submit and cancel actions
- **Alert** - Warning messages
- **Toast** - Success/error notifications

## 🔒 Access Control

**Requirements:**
1. Must be authenticated
2. Must have a clinic selected
3. Must be a doctor or clinic owner
4. User information must be loaded

**Guards in place:**
