## 🚀 Next Steps (Backend Data Filtering)

The frontend is complete. Next steps involve updating backend controllers to filter data by clinic:

### **Still TODO on Existing Pages:**

1. **AppointmentsPage** - Add clinic filter from context
2. **PrescriptionsPage** - Add clinic filter, hide create button for staff
3. **PatientsPage** - Add clinic filter, filter for doctors
4. **MedicationsPage** - Show 403 for staff
5. **ClinicSettingsPage** - Show 403 for non-owners

### **Example Implementation:**
```javascript
// In AppointmentsPage.jsx
import { useClinicContext } from '../contexts/ClinicContext';

export function AppointmentsPage() {
  const { selectedClinicId, userClinicRole } = useClinicContext();
  
  // Fetch appointments with clinic filter
  const { data } = useAppointments({ clinic: selectedClinicId });
  
  // ... rest of component
}
```

## 🎓 Developer Notes

### **Context Usage**
```javascript
import { useClinicContext } from '../contexts/ClinicContext';

const { 
  selectedClinic,      // Full clinic object
  selectedClinicId,    // Clinic ID string
  userClinicRole,      // 'clinic_owner' | 'doctor' | 'staff'
  switchClinic,        // Function to change clinic
  hasClinic,           // Boolean
  isLoading            // Boolean
} = useClinicContext();
```

### **Role Checking**
```javascript
import { PERMISSIONS } from '../utils/roleConfig';

if (PERMISSIONS.canCreatePrescription(userClinicRole)) {
  // Show create button
}
```

### **Auth Helpers**
```javascript
import { useAuth } from '../hooks/useAuth';

const { 
  user,                  // Backend user object
  hasClinics,            // Function: () => boolean
  canCreateClinic,       // Function: () => boolean
  getClinicRole,         // Function: (clinicId) => string
  isClinicOwner,         // Function: (clinicId) => boolean
  isDoctor,              // Function: (clinicId) => boolean
