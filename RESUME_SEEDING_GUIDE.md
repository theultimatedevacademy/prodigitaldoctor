# Resume CSV Seeding Guide

## Your Current Situation

‚úÖ **Compositions** - Seeded successfully  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Medications** - Partially seeded (~125,000 out of 250,154)  
‚ùå **Substitutes** - Not yet linked  
üìù **New Data** - Updated compositions.csv needs to be imported

## Solution: Resume Seeder

The resume seeder (`csvSeederResume.js`) can:
- ‚úÖ Update compositions WITHOUT clearing medications
- ‚úÖ Continue medication seeding (skips already created ones)
- ‚úÖ Link substitutes after all medications are loaded
- ‚úÖ Handle network interruptions gracefully

---

## Quick Start - Your Use Case

Based on your situation, run these commands in order:

### Step 1: Update Compositions (with new data)
```bash
npm run seed:compositions
```
This will:
- Add new compositions from compositions.csv
- Update descriptions of existing compositions
- NOT touch any medications

### Step 2: Resume Medication Seeding
```bash
npm run seed:csv-resume
```
Or just medications:
```bash
npm run seed:medications
```
This will:
- Skip the ~125,000 medications already created
- Continue from where it stopped
- Add remaining ~125,154 medications

### Step 3: Link Substitutes (after all medications are done)
```bash
npm run seed:link
```
This will:
- Find all medications with substitute references
- Link them by matching brand names
- Clean up temporary fields

## All Available Commands

### Full Resume (Recommended for your case)
```bash
npm run seed:csv-resume
```
Does: Compositions (upsert) + Medications (resume) + Link substitutes

### Compositions Only
```bash
npm run seed:compositions
```
Updates/adds compositions without touching medications

### Medications Only
```bash
npm run seed:medications
```
Resumes medication seeding, skips existing ones

### Link Substitutes Only
```bash
npm run seed:link
```
Links substitutes for all medications (run after medications are complete)

---

## How It Works

### Composition Upserting
- Finds composition by `name`
- If exists: Updates `description` if changed
- If new: Creates new composition
- **Does NOT delete** existing compositions

### Medication Resume
- Checks if medication already exists by:
  - `brandName` (exact match) OR
  - `genericName` + `exact_composition` combination
- If exists: Skips it
- If new: Creates it
- Stores substitute names in temporary `_substituteNames` field

### Substitute Linking
- Finds all medications with `_substituteNames` field
- Builds a map of all brand names ‚Üí ObjectIds
- Matches substitute names to medications
- Updates `substitutes` field with ObjectIds
- Removes temporary `_substituteNames` field

---

## Progress Tracking

The seeder shows detailed progress:

```
üì¶ Upserting compositions (update/insert mode)...
   Found 1913 compositions in CSV
   Processed 100 compositions...
‚úÖ Created 50 new, updated 1863, skipped 0

üíä Resuming medication seeding (skip existing mode)...
   Found 250154 medications in CSV
   Found 125000 existing medications in database
   Skipped 1000 existing medications...
   Created 1000 new medications (skipped 125000 existing)...
‚úÖ Created 125154 new medications
   Already existed: 125000

üîó Linking substitute medications...
   Found 50000 medications needing substitute links
   Building medication name map...
   Mapped 250154 brand names
   Processed 1000 medications...
‚úÖ Linked substitutes for 48500 medications
```

---

## Network Error Handling

If the seeder encounters a network error:
- It will show progress before exiting
- You can run it again - it will skip what's already done
- Safe to run multiple times

Example:
```
‚ùå Network connection lost!
üìä Progress: Created 10500 new medications, 125000 already existed
üí° Run this script again to resume from where it left off
```

Just run the same command again!

---

## Verification

After seeding completes, verify with:

```bash
# In MongoDB shell or Compass
db.compositions.countDocuments()  // Should show total compositions
db.medications.countDocuments()   // Should show ~250,154
db.medications.countDocuments({ substitutes: { $ne: [] } })  // Count with substitutes linked
```

Or check the final summary:
```
üìä Database Summary:
   - Total Compositions: 1913
   - Total Medications: 250154
   - New Medications Added: 125154
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Already exists" count seems wrong
- The seeder checks by `brandName` OR (`genericName` + `exact_composition`)
- If CSV has duplicates, they'll be counted as "already exists"

### Substitutes not linking
- Ensure all medications are seeded first
- Substitute names must match brand names exactly
- Run `npm run seed:link` after all medications are created

### Missing compositions warning
- Some medications reference compositions not in compositions.csv
- The medication will be created but without those composition links
- Add missing compositions to compositions.csv and re-run

### Network keeps disconnecting
- Run in smaller batches (modify the code to limit CSV rows)
- Or run during stable network hours
- The resume feature lets you continue safely

## Direct Command (No NPM)

```bash
# Full resume
node server/seeders/csvSeederResume.js

# Compositions only
node server/seeders/csvSeederResume.js --compositions-only

# Medications only  
node server/seeders/csvSeederResume.js --medications-only

# Link only
node server/seeders/csvSeederResume.js --link-only
```

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **The resume seeder does NOT clear existing data**
- Original seeder (`csvSeeder.js`) clears everything first
- Resume seeder (`csvSeederResume.js`) is additive/update mode

‚úÖ **Safe to run multiple times**
- Compositions: Updates existing, adds new
- Medications: Skips existing, adds new
- Linking: Re-processes all that need linking

üîÑ **When to use which seeder**
- **Fresh start / Reset**: Use `npm run seed:csv` (clears all)
- **Resume / Update**: Use `npm run seed:csv-resume` (keeps existing)
