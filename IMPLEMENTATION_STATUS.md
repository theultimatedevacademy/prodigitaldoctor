# Implementation Status - Clinic Management System

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** Backend Complete ‚úÖ | Frontend Pending ‚è≥

## Summary

Complete backend implementation of clinic-scoped role-based access control (RBAC) with subscription management. The system now supports:

- **Clinic-specific roles** (no global roles)
- **Subscription tiers** with clinic creation limits
- **30-day free trial** for new users
- **Staff invitation system** (requires existing users)
- **Role-based data filtering** (doctors see only their data, staff see all)

## Testing Status

### ‚úÖ Ready to Test
1. User signup with free plan
2. Start free trial
3. Create clinic (with subscription check)
