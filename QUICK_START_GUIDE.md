## üîß Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Role Modal Not Appearing

**Check**:
```bash
# 1. Is user created in MongoDB?
db.users.findOne({ clerkId: "user_xxx" })

# 2. Check roles field
# If roles: [], modal should appear
# If roles: ["doctor"], modal should NOT appear
```

**Fix**: Ensure user.roles is empty array for new users

---

### Issue: Wrong Dashboard

**Check**: `RoleBasedDashboard.jsx` priority logic
```javascript
// Priority order:
1. doctor/clinic_owner ‚Üí DoctorDashboard
2. assistant ‚Üí DoctorDashboard  
3. patient ‚Üí PatientDashboard
```

---

### Issue: Cannot Submit Role

**Check Browser Console**:
- Look for network errors
- Check API endpoint is `/api/auth/my-role`
- Verify token is being sent

**Server Logs**:
- Check for validation errors
- Verify MongoDB connection
- Check Clerk SDK errors
