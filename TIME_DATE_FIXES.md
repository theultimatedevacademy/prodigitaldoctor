# Time Selector and Date Format Fixes

## Changes Made

### 1. Time Selector Fixes (Both FirstVisitForm and FollowUpForm)

**Issue Fixed:** Time selector wasn't working properly

**Solution:**
- Fixed `parseTime()` function to properly convert hour values to strings
- Changed from `return { hour: hourStr, minute: minuteStr, period: 'AM' }` 
- To `return { hour: String(hour24), minute: minuteStr, period: 'AM' }`
- This ensures hour values like "1", "2", "3" work correctly with the select dropdown

**How it works:**
1. User selects hour (1-12) from dropdown
2. User selects minute (00, 15, 30, 45) from dropdown  
3. User selects AM/PM from dropdown
4. Example: Selecting "7", "30", "PM" → saves as "19:30" internally
5. When form loads with "19:30" → displays as hour="7", minute="30", period="PM"

**Time Format:**
- **Internal storage:** 24-hour format (HH:mm) - e.g., "19:30", "07:30", "00:00", "12:30"
- **Display format:** 12-hour format with separate dropdowns - e.g., "07 : 30 PM"

### 2. Date Format Display

**Issue Fixed:** Date was showing in MM/DD/YYYY format

**Solution:**
- Added `formatDateToDDMMYYYY()` function to convert ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) to DD/MM/YYYY
- Replaced `Input` component with native `<input type="date">` to have more control
- Added "Selected: DD/MM/YYYY" display below the date picker
- Example: Internal "2025-10-15" → displays "Selected: 15/10/2025"

**Date Format:**
- **Internal storage:** ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) - e.g., "2025-10-15"
- **Display format:** DD/MM/YYYY - e.g., "15/10/2025"
- **Browser date picker:** Shows in user's locale format (varies by browser/OS)
- **Confirmation text:** Always shows "Selected: 15/10/2025" for clarity

## Testing Checklist

### Time Selector
- [ ] Select hour from dropdown (1-12)
- [ ] Select minute from dropdown (00, 15, 30, 45)
- [ ] Select AM from dropdown → verify time is correct
- [ ] Select PM from dropdown → verify time converts correctly
- [ ] Test edge cases:
  - [ ] 12:00 AM → should save as 00:00
  - [ ] 12:30 PM → should save as 12:30
  - [ ] 1:00 AM → should save as 01:00
  - [ ] 1:00 PM → should save as 13:00
  - [ ] 11:45 PM → should save as 23:45

### Date Display
- [ ] Open date picker - should show calendar
- [ ] Select a date
- [ ] Verify "Selected: DD/MM/YYYY" appears below the picker
- [ ] Click "Today" button → verify date updates
- [ ] Click "Tomorrow" button → verify date updates
- [ ] Submit form → verify date is saved in correct format

### Form Submission
- [ ] Fill out First Visit form completely
- [ ] Verify appointment is created with correct time
- [ ] Fill out Follow Up form completely
- [ ] Verify appointment is created with correct time
- [ ] Check database to confirm time is stored in 24-hour format

## Expected Behavior

### Time Example: "7:30 PM"
```
User sees: 
Hour dropdown: 07
Minute dropdown: 30
Period dropdown: PM

Internal value: "19:30"
```

### Date Example: "15th October 2025"
```
User sees in date picker: (browser locale format)
User sees confirmation: "Selected: 15/10/2025"

Internal value: "2025-10-15"
```

## Notes
- Time will remain empty until all three components (hour, minute, AM/PM) are selected
- This is intentional to prevent partial time values
- Date format in the native picker will vary by browser and user locale
- The "Selected: DD/MM/YYYY" text provides consistent confirmation of the selected date
